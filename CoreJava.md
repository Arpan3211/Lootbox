## **Core Java**

### Features of Java

1. **Object-Oriented**  
   Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Platform-Independent**  
   Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, embodying the principle of “write once, run anywhere.”

3. **Simple and Easy to Learn**  
   Java’s syntax is similar to C and C++, making it easier for developers to learn and use.

4. **Robust Security**  
   Java includes built-in security features such as bytecode verification, secure class loading, and a robust security manager, making it ideal for building secure applications.

5. **Multithreading**  
   Java supports multithreading, enabling the execution of multiple threads simultaneously to improve performance and responsiveness.

6. **Automatic Memory Management**  
   Java provides automatic garbage collection, freeing developers from manual memory management and reducing the risk of memory leaks.

7. **Dynamic Loading of Classes**  
   Java allows for the dynamic loading of classes, making applications more flexible and modular.

8. **Extensive Libraries and APIs**  
   Java offers a wide range of libraries and APIs, including the Java Standard Edition (SE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) APIs, suitable for diverse applications.

9. **High-Performance**  
   Java achieves high performance through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and runtime optimizations.

10. **Garbage Collection**  
    Java’s garbage collector periodically frees unused memory, reducing the need for manual memory management and minimizing memory-related errors.

11. **Encapsulation**  
    Java enables developers to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary information, promoting code reuse and modularity.

12. **Inheritance**  
    Java’s inheritance feature allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes, encouraging code reuse and better organization.

### **What is a Compiler?**

A **compiler** is a software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language (such as Java) into machine code or an intermediate form that can be executed by a computer. In Java, the compiler converts source code (`.java` files) into an intermediate form called **bytecode** (`.class` files).

Key points about the Java Compiler:

1. The compiler ensures the source code is free from syntax errors before execution.
2. In Java, the compiler (e.g., `javac`) converts Java code into **bytecode**, which is platform-independent.

### **How JVM Works in Java**

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying hardware or operating system, enabling Java's platform independence.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how JVM works:

---

#### **1. Compilation Phase**

- Source code (`.java`) → Compiled by `javac` → Bytecode (`.class`).
- Bytecode is a set of instructions that can be understood by the JVM.

#### **2. Class Loader Subsystem**

- **Class Loading:** The JVM's class loader loads the required `.class` files into memory.
- **Class Linking:** Verifies bytecode and resolves dependencies among classes.
- **Class Initialization:** Prepares static variables and runs static blocks.

#### **3. Execution Engine**

The Execution Engine is the core component of the JVM responsible for executing bytecode.

- **Interpreter:** Executes bytecode line by line, which can be slower due to repeated interpretation of frequently used code.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code during runtime for faster execution.

#### **4. Memory Areas in JVM**

JVM uses several memory areas to execute applications:

- **Method Area:** Stores class metadata, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap Area:** Stores objects and their instance variables (shared among threads).
- **Stack Area:** Stores method-specific local variables and function call data (specific to each thread).
- **Program Counter Register (PC):** Keeps track of the current execution point in the bytecode.
- **Native Method Stack:** Handles native code execution.

#### **5. Garbage Collection**

- JVM manages memory automatically by identifying and freeing unused objects in the heap.

---

### **Execution Flow**

1. Java source code is compiled into bytecode using `javac`.
2. The JVM loads the bytecode via the **class loader**.
3. The bytecode is verified for security and correctness.
4. The **Execution Engine** interprets or compiles the bytecode to native machine code.
5. The program is executed with automatic memory management by the garbage collector.

### ** classes and objects in Java**

### **Class in Java**

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of that class will have. In other words, a class is a collection of attributes and methods that represent the common characteristics and behaviors of objects.

A class can contain:

- **Fields (Variables)**: These are the properties or attributes that define the state of the objects.
- **Methods**: These define the actions or behaviors that can be performed on the objects.
- **Constructors**: These are special methods used to initialize objects.
- **Access Modifiers**: These specify the visibility of fields, methods, and classes (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`).

#### Syntax for a Class:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (attributes)
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

### **Object in Java**

An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, the class serves as a blueprint, and the object contains the actual data for the properties defined in the class.

Each object has:

- **State**: The values of the attributes (fields).
- **Behavior**: The methods that can be called on the object.
- **Identity**: A unique reference to the object in memory.

#### Creating an Object:

You create an object by using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Tesla", 2024);

        // Accessing the object's methods
        myCar.displayDetails();
    }
}
```

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (the class). It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components using access modifiers like `private` or `protected` to hide implementation details.

   - Example: The `color`, `model`, and `year` attributes in the `Car` class can be encapsulated using private access modifiers, making them accessible only through getter and setter methods.

2. **Constructor**: A constructor is a special type of method used to initialize an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

   - Example: `public Car(String color, String model, int year) { ... }` is a constructor in the `Car` class that initializes the object's state.

3. **Methods**: Methods define the behaviors of the objects. They can modify the object's state or perform actions.

   - Example: The `displayDetails()` method in the `Car` class displays the car's details.

4. **Inheritance**: A class can inherit fields and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and extension of functionality. This is achieved using the `extends` keyword.

   - Example: If we create a `SportsCar` class that inherits from `Car`, it will automatically have the `color`, `model`, and `year` attributes, and the `displayDetails()` method.

5. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The actual method that is called is determined at runtime (dynamic polymorphism) or compile time (static polymorphism).

   - Example: A `SportsCar` object can be treated as a `Car` object, and the appropriate methods for the actual object type will be called.

6. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces are used to hide implementation details and expose only the essential features of the object. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.
   - Example: An abstract `Vehicle` class can define a general `move()` method, and subclasses like `Car` and `Bike` can implement it in their own way.

### **Example of Class and Object:**

```java
// Class Definition
public class Car {
    // Fields
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Main class to create an object and use it
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Blue", "Honda Civic", 2020);

        // Calling the method on the object
        myCar.displayDetails(); // Outputs car details
    }
}
```

### **Summary:**

- **Class**: A blueprint that defines properties and behaviors.
- **Object**: An instance of a class with specific values for properties.
- **Constructors**: Special methods used for object initialization.
- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**: Core OOP principles that help in building modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
