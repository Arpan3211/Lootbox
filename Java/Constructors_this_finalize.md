### The `this` Keyword:
Sometimes a method will need to refer to the object that invoked it. To allow this, Java defines the `this` keyword. `this` can be used inside any method to refer to the current object. In other words, `this` is always a reference to the object on which the method was invoked.

### `final` Keyword:
A field can be declared as `final`. Doing so prevents its contents from being modified, making it essentially a constant. This means that you must initialize a `final` field when it is declared.

It is a common coding convention to choose all uppercase identifiers for final fields:
```java
final int FILE_OPEN = 2;
```

However, `final` guarantees immutability only when instance variables are primitive types, not reference types. If an instance variable of a reference type has the `final` modifier, the value of that instance variable (the reference to an object) will never change—it will always refer to the same object—but the value of the object itself can change.

### The `finalize()` Method:
Sometimes, an object will need to perform some action when it is destroyed. To handle such situations, Java provides a mechanism called finalization. By using finalization, you can define specific actions that will occur when an object is about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the `finalize()` method. The Java runtime calls that method whenever it is about to recycle an object of that class. Right before an asset is freed, the Java runtime calls the `finalize()` method on the object.

```java
protected void finalize() {
    // finalization code here
}
```

### Constructors:
Once defined, the constructor is automatically called when the object is created, before the `new` operator completes. Constructors look a little strange because they have no return type, not even `void`. This is because the implicit return type of a class' constructor is the class type itself.

In the line:
```java
Box mybox1 = new Box();
```
`new Box()` is calling the `Box()` constructor.

### Inheritance and Constructors in Java:
In Java, the constructor of the base class with no argument gets automatically called in the derived class constructor. For example, the output of the following program is:

```
Base Class Constructor Called
Derived Class Constructor Called
```

```java
// filename: Main.java
class Base {
  Base() {
    System.out.println("Base Class Constructor Called");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  Derived() {
    System.out.println("Derived Class Constructor Called");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Derived d = new Derived();
  }
}
```

Every class has a default constructor, regardless of whether we declare it in the class or not. If we inherit a class, the derived class must call its superclass constructor. This is done automatically in the derived class. If the derived class does not have a default constructor, the JVM will invoke its default constructor and call the superclass constructor by default.

If the derived class has a parameterized constructor, it still calls the default superclass constructor by default. In this case, if the superclass does not have a default constructor but instead has a parameterized constructor, the derived class constructor should explicitly call the parameterized superclass constructor.
