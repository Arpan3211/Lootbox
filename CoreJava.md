## Q2: What is a Compiler?

A **compiler** is a software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language (such as Java) into machine code or an intermediate form that can be executed by a computer. In Java, the compiler converts source code (`.java` files) into an intermediate form called **bytecode** (`.class` files).

Key points about the Java Compiler:

1. The compiler ensures the source code is free from syntax errors before execution.
2. In Java, the compiler (e.g., `javac`) converts Java code into **bytecode**, which is platform-independent.

### **How JVM Works in Java**

The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It acts as an interpreter between the bytecode and the underlying hardware or operating system, enabling Java's platform independence.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how JVM works:

#### **1. Compilation Phase**

- Source code (`.java`) → Compiled by `javac` → Bytecode (`.class`).
- Bytecode is a set of instructions that can be understood by the JVM.

#### **2. Class Loader Subsystem**

- **Class Loading:** The JVM's class loader loads the required `.class` files into memory.
- **Class Linking:** Verifies bytecode and resolves dependencies among classes.
- **Class Initialization:** Prepares static variables and runs static blocks.

#### **3. Execution Engine**

The Execution Engine is the core component of the JVM responsible for executing bytecode.

- **Interpreter:** Executes bytecode line by line, which can be slower due to repeated interpretation of frequently used code.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:** Converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code during runtime for faster execution.

#### **4. Memory Areas in JVM**

JVM uses several memory areas to execute applications:

- **Method Area:** Stores class metadata, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap Area:** Stores objects and their instance variables (shared among threads).
- **Stack Area:** Stores method-specific local variables and function call data (specific to each thread).
- **Program Counter Register (PC):** Keeps track of the current execution point in the bytecode.
- **Native Method Stack:** Handles native code execution.

#### **5. Garbage Collection**

- JVM manages memory automatically by identifying and freeing unused objects in the heap.

### **Execution Flow**

1. Java source code is compiled into bytecode using `javac`.
2. The JVM loads the bytecode via the **class loader**.
3. The bytecode is verified for security and correctness.
4. The **Execution Engine** interprets or compiles the bytecode to native machine code.
5. The program is executed with automatic memory management by the garbage collector.

## Q3: classes and objects in Java

### **Class in Java**

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of that class will have. In other words, a class is a collection of attributes and methods that represent the common characteristics and behaviors of objects.

A class can contain:

- **Fields (Variables)**: These are the properties or attributes that define the state of the objects.
- **Methods**: These define the actions or behaviors that can be performed on the objects.
- **Constructors**: These are special methods used to initialize objects.
- **Access Modifiers**: These specify the visibility of fields, methods, and classes (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`).

#### Syntax for a Class:

```java
public class Car {
    // Fields (attributes)
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method (behavior)
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);
    }
}
```

### **Object in Java**

An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object from a class, the class serves as a blueprint, and the object contains the actual data for the properties defined in the class.

Each object has:

- **State**: The values of the attributes (fields).
- **Behavior**: The methods that can be called on the object.
- **Identity**: A unique reference to the object in memory.

#### Creating an Object:

You create an object by using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Red", "Tesla", 2024);

        // Accessing the object's methods
        myCar.displayDetails();
    }
}
```

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit (the class). It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components using access modifiers like `private` or `protected` to hide implementation details.

   - Example: The `color`, `model`, and `year` attributes in the `Car` class can be encapsulated using private access modifiers, making them accessible only through getter and setter methods.

2. **Constructor**: A constructor is a special type of method used to initialize an object when it is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

   - Example: `public Car(String color, String model, int year) { ... }` is a constructor in the `Car` class that initializes the object's state.

3. **Methods**: Methods define the behaviors of the objects. They can modify the object's state or perform actions.

   - Example: The `displayDetails()` method in the `Car` class displays the car's details.

4. **Inheritance**: A class can inherit fields and methods from another class, allowing for code reuse and extension of functionality. This is achieved using the `extends` keyword.

   - Example: If we create a `SportsCar` class that inherits from `Car`, it will automatically have the `color`, `model`, and `year` attributes, and the `displayDetails()` method.

5. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The actual method that is called is determined at runtime (dynamic polymorphism) or compile time (static polymorphism).

   - Example: A `SportsCar` object can be treated as a `Car` object, and the appropriate methods for the actual object type will be called.

6. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces are used to hide implementation details and expose only the essential features of the object. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.
   - Example: An abstract `Vehicle` class can define a general `move()` method, and subclasses like `Car` and `Bike` can implement it in their own way.

### **Example of Class and Object:**

```java
// Class Definition
public class Car {
    // Fields
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method to display car details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Car Model: " + model);
        System.out.println("Car Color: " + color);
        System.out.println("Car Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Main class to create an object and use it
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Blue", "Honda Civic", 2020);

        // Calling the method on the object
        myCar.displayDetails(); // Outputs car details
    }
}
```

### **Summary:**

- **Class**: A blueprint that defines properties and behaviors.
- **Object**: An instance of a class with specific values for properties.
- **Constructors**: Special methods used for object initialization.
- **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**: Core OOP principles that help in building modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Q4: wrapper classes in Java?

In Java, **wrapper classes** are a set of classes in the `java.lang` package that provide a way to use primitive data types (like `int`, `double`, `char`, etc.) as objects. Each primitive type in Java has a corresponding wrapper class. For example:

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| `byte`         | `Byte`        |
| `short`        | `Short`       |
| `int`          | `Integer`     |
| `long`         | `Long`        |
| `float`        | `Float`       |
| `double`       | `Double`      |
| `char`         | `Character`   |
| `boolean`      | `Boolean`     |

### Why Use Wrapper Classes?

1. **Object-Oriented Context**: Some Java APIs require objects instead of primitive types. Wrapper classes help bridge this gap.
2. **Collections Framework**: Classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc., can only store objects, not primitives.
3. **Utility Methods**: Wrapper classes provide utility methods for converting data, parsing strings, etc.

### Key Features of Wrapper Classes

1. **Autoboxing and Unboxing**:

   - **Autoboxing**: Automatic conversion of a primitive to its corresponding wrapper class object.
     ```java
     int num = 5;
     Integer obj = num;  // Autoboxing
     ```
   - **Unboxing**: Automatic conversion of a wrapper class object back to its corresponding primitive.
     ```java
     Integer obj = 10;
     int num = obj;  // Unboxing
     ```

2. **Immutability**: Wrapper class objects are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.

3. **Static Utility Methods**: They provide methods like `parseXxx()` to convert strings to corresponding primitives.

   ```java
   String str = "123";
   int num = Integer.parseInt(str);  // Convert string to int
   ```

4. **Constants**: Some wrapper classes have constants like `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

### Example of Using Wrapper Classes

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class WrapperClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Autoboxing
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        numbers.add(10);  // Autoboxing converts int to Integer

        // Unboxing
        int num = numbers.get(0);  // Unboxing converts Integer to int

        // Utility methods
        String str = "50";
        int parsedNumber = Integer.parseInt(str);  // Parsing string to int

        System.out.println("ArrayList element: " + num);
        System.out.println("Parsed number: " + parsedNumber);
    }
}
```

### When to Use Wrapper Classes?

- When working with generic classes in Java Collections.
- When primitive data needs to interact with classes or methods that require objects.
- When using features like `null` values for primitives (which is not possible without wrapper classes).

#### Wrapper classes play a crucial role in bridging the gap between Java's object-oriented features and its primitive types.

## Q5: Packages in Java ?

In Java, **packages** are used to organize classes and interfaces into namespaces, making it easier to manage and access them. They are a way to group related types (classes, interfaces, enums, and annotations) to avoid naming conflicts and improve code maintainability.

### Key Features of Packages

1. **Namespace Management**: Packages help prevent naming conflicts. For instance, two classes with the same name can exist in different packages.
2. **Access Protection**: They control access levels of classes and members. The `protected` and default (package-private) access modifiers are package-specific.
3. **Reusability**: Code in one package can be reused in another without redundancy.
4. **Categorization**: Logical grouping of classes and interfaces improves project organization and readability.
5. **Versioning**: Packages can be used to manage different versions of classes and interfaces, making
   it easier to maintain and update codebases.
6. **Dependency Management**: Packages help manage dependencies between classes and interfaces, making it easier to understand.
7. **Security**: Packages can be used to control access to classes and interfaces, improving security.
8. **Scalability**: Packages make it easier to scale large projects by organizing code into logical
   groups.
9. **Portability**: Packages make it easier to move code between projects and platforms.
10. **Readability**: Packages improve code readability by grouping related classes and interfaces together.

### Types of Packages

1. **Built-in Packages**:
   These are provided by Java, and you can use them directly.

   - Examples:
     - `java.lang` (automatically imported; contains core classes like `String`, `Math`, etc.)
     - `java.util` (utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, etc.)
     - `java.io` (classes for input-output operations like `FileReader`, `BufferedWriter`, etc.)

2. **User-defined Packages**:
   These are created by developers to organize their project structure.

### Creating a Package

To create a package:

1. Declare it at the top of your Java file using the `package` keyword.
2. Save the file in a directory matching the package name.

#### Example:

```java
package com.example.myapp; // Declares the package

public class MyClass {
    public void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("Hello from MyClass in com.example.myapp package!");
    }
}
```

### Using a Package

To use a class or interface from a package, you can:

1. **Fully Qualified Name**:
   ```java
   com.example.myapp.MyClass obj = new com.example.myapp.MyClass();
   ```
2. **Import Statement**:
   - Import specific classes:
     ```java
     import com.example.myapp.MyClass;
     MyClass obj = new MyClass();
     ```
   - Import all classes in a package:
     ```java
     import com.example.myapp.*;
     ```

### Package Access Modifiers

- **Public**: Accessible from any package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
- **Default (no modifier)**: Accessible only within the same package.
- **Private**: Not accessible outside the class.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure should match the package name:

```
com/
  example/
    myapp/
      MyClass.java
```

When compiled, the `.class` files are placed in the same structure.

### Common Java Package Commands

1. **Compile with packages**:
   Use `-d` option to set the base directory for the package:

   ```bash
   javac -d . MyClass.java
   ```

   This places the compiled `.class` files in the appropriate directories.

2. **Run with packages**:
   Use the fully qualified class name:
   ```bash
   java com.example.myapp.MyClass
   ```

#### Packages are crucial for structuring large Java applications and managing dependencies effectively.
