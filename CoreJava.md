## **Core Java**

### Features of Java

1. **Object-Oriented**  
   Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Platform-Independent**  
   Java code can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, embodying the principle of “write once, run anywhere.”

3. **Simple and Easy to Learn**  
   Java’s syntax is similar to C and C++, making it easier for developers to learn and use.

4. **Robust Security**  
   Java includes built-in security features such as bytecode verification, secure class loading, and a robust security manager, making it ideal for building secure applications.

5. **Multithreading**  
   Java supports multithreading, enabling the execution of multiple threads simultaneously to improve performance and responsiveness.

6. **Automatic Memory Management**  
   Java provides automatic garbage collection, freeing developers from manual memory management and reducing the risk of memory leaks.

7. **Dynamic Loading of Classes**  
   Java allows for the dynamic loading of classes, making applications more flexible and modular.

8. **Extensive Libraries and APIs**  
   Java offers a wide range of libraries and APIs, including the Java Standard Edition (SE) and Enterprise Edition (EE) APIs, suitable for diverse applications.

9. **High-Performance**  
   Java achieves high performance through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and runtime optimizations.

10. **Garbage Collection**  
    Java’s garbage collector periodically frees unused memory, reducing the need for manual memory management and minimizing memory-related errors.

11. **Encapsulation**  
    Java enables developers to hide implementation details and expose only the necessary information, promoting code reuse and modularity.

12. **Inheritance**  
    Java’s inheritance feature allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes, encouraging code reuse and better organization.
